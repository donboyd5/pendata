# Q&A and Discussion Log

## Purpose

This document maintains a running log of our discussions, decisions, and Q&A sessions throughout the pension data package preparation project.

## Session: 2025-09-02

### Initial Setup

**Discussion**: Setting up the claude folder as a Quarto book project for communication and documentation.

**Decisions Made**:
1. Created Quarto book structure with four initial chapters
2. Established workflow where User provides instructions and Claude reads .qmd files at session start
3. Confirmed git repository structure (root at E:/R_projects/Reason/pendata/)
4. Claude has permissions to make changes following safe git practices

**Key Points**:
- Authentication is already handled
- Main communication hub is the data-raw/claude folder
- Project is an R data package called "pendata"
- Current git branch: get-constants

### Project Structure Confirmed

The project is structured as an R package with:
- `/data/`: Processed data files
- `/data-raw/`: Raw data and processing scripts
- `/R/`: Package functions
- `/man/`: Documentation
- `/tests/`: Tests
- `/data-raw/claude/`: Our communication hub

### Project Scope and Goals

**Discussion**: Clarified the core purpose and structure of the pendata package.

**Key Insights**:
1. **Two Essential Functions**:
   - Process raw pension plan data into uniform formats
   - Create finished .rda files (one per plan) in the `/data/` folder

2. **Current Focus Plans**:
   - **Florida Retirement System (FRS)**: Very far along but not complete
   - **Texas Teachers Retirement System (TxTRS)**: Barely started
   - Future: 10-20 additional plans planned

3. **Processing Structure**:
   - Each plan has its own folder in `/data-raw/plans/`
   - Raw data stored in `extracted_data/` subfolders (e.g., .xlsm files)
   - Processing done via .qmd files in plan folders
   - Output: single .rda file per plan in `/data/`

4. **Standardization Strategy**:
   - Make processing as uniform as possible across plans
   - Reuse code wherever feasible
   - Accept that complete uniformity isn't possible due to plan idiosyncrasies
   - Focus on creating reusable components and patterns

**Action Items**:
- Get FRS and TxTRS plans finished in near term
- Identify reusable code patterns across plans
- Document plan-specific idiosyncrasies as they're discovered

### FRS Processing Review Results

**Critical Finding**: The retirement_rates processing files contain wrong content!
- `retirement_rates.qmd` - Actually processes retirees data, not retirement rates
- `stage_retirement_rates.qmd` - Has title "Stage: Retirees" and code is commented out
- `test_retirement_rates.qmd` - References retirees data, not retirement rates
- No `retirement_rates.rds` file is created in staged_data

**Other Gaps Identified**:
1. Missing explicit test/stage files for:
   - headcount_salary
   - salary_growth  
   - withdrawal
2. Incomplete validation framework
3. No cross-component consistency checks

**Processing Pipeline Confirmed**:
1. Extract data from Excel → work_data
2. Process each component → test → stage
3. Assemble all staged .rds files → final frs.rda
