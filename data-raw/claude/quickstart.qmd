# Quick Start Instructions for Claude

Please read all .qmd files in the E:/R_projects/Reason/pendata/data-raw/claude/ folder to understand our current workflow, recent discussions, and pending tasks. Start by:

1. Reading index.qmd for workflow instructions
2. Reading qa.qmd for recent discussion context
3. Reading todo.qmd for pending tasks
4. Checking for any topic-specific chapter files

The project root (E:/R_projects/Reason/pendata/) is a git repository. You have permission to make changes following safe git practices.
