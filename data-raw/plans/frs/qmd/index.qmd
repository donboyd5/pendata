# Introduction

This quarto project is part of a repo called pendata. This quarto project prepares Florida FRS data for inclusion in the `pendata` package. The Florida FRS data used in this quarto project were extracted from source documents in the data extraction subproject of this repo.


## TODO:

- define classes and longer class names in a separate sheet?
- deal with calibration constants that currently include the target minus a calculated value (or vice versa)
- ONGOING - update frs_extracted_data_v<#>.xlsm file
- DONE plan field name -- add system column to pendata files
- DONE -- amortization_bases has multiple NA columns - delete them in the next extracted_data xlsm file
- DONE -- withdrawal_eco info has note with NA value
