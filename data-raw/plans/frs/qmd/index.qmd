# Introduction

This quarto subproject is part of the repo `pendata`, which provides public pension plan data for `penmodel` in a format that is consisstent from plan to plan. This subproject prepares data for Florida FRS, creating the file `frs.rda`.

The steps are:

- *Outside* of this package, analysts put ALL data for a plan into an Excel file and, following rules laid out elsewhere, and copy that Excel file into the `extracted_data` folder for the plan. For example, the file for FRS is "data-raw\plans\frs\extracted_data\frs_extracted_data_v5.xlsm".

- Render a quarto project that is specific to the plan in question. (A quarto project is a set of `.qmd` markdown files plus a `_quarto.yml` "recipe" file that says which files will be rendered, in what order.)

- Build the package

- See the *Steps* chapter for details.

## TODO:

- define classes and longer class names in a separate sheet?
- deal with calibration constants that currently include the target minus a calculated value (or vice versa)
- ONGOING - update frs_extracted_data_v<#>.xlsm file
- DONE plan field name -- add system column to pendata files
- DONE -- amortization_bases has multiple NA columns - delete them in the next extracted_data xlsm file
- DONE -- withdrawal_eco info has note with NA value
