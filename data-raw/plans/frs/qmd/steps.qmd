# Steps

Load functions needed for re-rendering and for package building:
   *source(here::here("R", "internal_functions.R"))*

##  Completely re-render a plan from scratch (e.g., frs):

-   see which files should be deleted for complete reset: *reset_all("frs")*
-   delete the files: *reset_all("frs", delete=TRUE)*
-   open terminal in the plan qmd folder: *reset_all("frs", delete=TRUE)*
-   in the terminal, do full re-render of the plan: *quarto render*

This does a soup-to-nuts preparation of data for a single plan:

-   gets the data from the plan spreadsheet
-   reformats the data creating interim files as needed
-   runs tests on the data
-   saves package-ready data to an interim folder
-   assembles all of the package-ready data files into a plan list
-   saves the final plan list to the package data folder (e.g., frs.rda will be saved to the top-level data folder)

## Build the package with the updated plan data

-   make sure the internal functions have been sourced: *source(here::here("R", "internal_functions.R"))*
-   from the console, run: *buildit()*

This function:

-   unloads the *pendata* package if loaded
-   uninstalls the package
-   clears the global environment
-   rebuilds and installs the *pendata* package
-   loads the package
-   prints the package version

You can now do something like: "plan <- pendata::frs" or "plan <- pendata::txtrs" and use the plan in penmodel.
