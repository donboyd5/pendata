# Introduction

This quarto project examines an Excel data workbook for a pension plan. It:

-   Gets all of the data sheets and their metadata, puts them into a list, and saves them as an .rds file
-   Checks to see whether the data has the minimum number and kind of sheets required
-   Runs selected tests on the data to see whether it meets requirements
-   For each sheet, shows its metadata and data

<!-- The goal is to find problems as early as possible in the process. -->

## Setting up the Excel workbook

-   Remove any information below the last data row (e.g., footnotes) so that the data area is defined by the start_col, end_col, start_row, and all non-empty cells below the start row
